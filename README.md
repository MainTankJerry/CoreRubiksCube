Core Rublik's Cube is a piece of code to implement basic implementation of Rubik's Cube.  It does not offer any graphical user interface nor feature to solve the cube.  It does, however, provide turn faces or to reverse those turns to find the state of the cube programmatically.

### Usage

You may instantiate a cube with initialized positions, and print it as follows.

```.swift
let cube1 = Cube()
print(cube1)
```

The cube's state should be printed to console as follows. As you can see, each tile has it's own unique identifier on it.

```
|   |   |   |U18|U19|U20|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |U10|U11|U12|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |U01|U02|U03|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|L18|L10|L01|F01|F02|F03|R03|R12|R20|B20|B19|B18|
|L21|L13|L04|F04|F05|F06|R06|R14|R23|B23|B22|B21|
|L24|L15|L07|F07|F08|F09|R09|R17|R26|B26|B25|B24|
|   |   |   |D07|D08|D09|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |D15|D16|D17|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |D24|D25|D26|   |   |   |   |   |   |
```

For getting some ideas about faces on a cube, here is the image of the unfolded faces of a cube. F, B, U, D, L and R are stands for front, back, up, down, left and right.  They are commonly used for Rubik's Cube community.

```
    +---+
    | U |
+---+---+---+---+
| L | F | R | B |
+---+---+---+---+
    | D |
    +---+
```

Then you may turn front face counter clockwise and print as follows. 

```.swift
let cube2 = cube1.makeFront(.counterclockwise)
print(cube2)
```
 You will find front face and it's related cubelets are rotated counter clockwise.
 

```
|   |   |   |U18|U19|U20|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |U10|U11|U12|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |R03|R06|R09|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|L18|L10|U03|F03|F06|F09|D09|R12|R20|B20|B19|B18|
|L21|L13|U02|F02|F05|F08|D08|R14|R23|B23|B22|B21|
|L24|L15|U01|F01|F04|F07|D07|R17|R26|B26|B25|B24|
|   |   |   |L01|L04|L07|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |D15|D16|D17|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |D24|D25|D26|   |   |   |   |   |   |
```

You may examine any surface by accessing `front`, `back`, `up`, `down`, `left` and `right` properties.  Here is the code to print `front` surface of the cube.

```.swift
print(cube.front)
```
You can find 9 identifiers from a surface, and each identifier represent an unique tile of a cube.

```
F01|F02|F03
F04|F05|F06
F07|F08|F09
```

All tiles on a cube are defined as enum as follows.

```.swift
public enum Tile {
	case F01, F02, F03, F06, F09, F08, F07, F04, F05	// front
	case U18, U19, U20, U12, U03, U02, U01, U10, U11	// up
	case R03, R12, R20, R23, R26, R17, R09, R06, R14	// right
	case B24, B25, B26, B23, B20, B19, B18, B21, B22	// back
	case D07, D08, D09, D17, D26, D25, D24, D15, D16	// down
	case L18, L10, L01, L04, L07, L15, L24, L21, L13	// left
}
```

Tile positions on a surface are described as follows.

```
+---+---+---+
| a | b | c |
+---+---+---+
| d | e | f |
+---+---+---+
| g | h | i |
+---+---+---+
```

So, you can access to any position of a surface by accessing `a`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h` and `i` properties. 

```.swift
cube.front.g // F07
cube.up.b // U19
cube.back.a // B20
```

You may make a turn of any surface of a cube. `Cube` provides some method to make a single rotation of any face of a cube.  Those methods do not make any changes of the instance itself, rather they return a new instance with made rotation given by parameter `Turn`.

```.swift
public func makeFront(_ turn: Turn) -> Cube
public func makeBack(_ turn: Turn) -> Cube
public func makeUp(_ turn: Turn) -> Cube
public func makeDown(_ turn: Turn) -> Cube
public func makeleft(_ turn: Turn) -> Cube
public func makeRight(_ turn: Turn) -> Cube
```

Turn describe which direction to make a turn either `clockwise`, `counterclockwise` or `double`.  `Double` turns a surface twice in the same direction, therefore, regardless clockwise or counter clockwise, the results are the same.

```.swift
public enum Turn {
	case clockwise
	case counterclockwise
	case `double`
}
```

You may provide a sequence of `Movement` which describes face and turn direction to perform multiple turns in once just like following example.


```.swift
let moves: [Movement] = 
[
	.front(turn: .clockwise),
	.back(turn: .clockwise),
	.left(turn: .counterclockwise),
	.right(turn: .counterclockwise),
	.up(turn: .double),
	.down(turn: .double)
]
let cube3 = cube.makeMoves(moves)
```

You may perform the same sequence backward to reverse the operation.

```.swift
let cube4 = cube3.reverseMoves(moves)
```

Since, `Cube` conforms to `Equatable` protocol,  you may make sure reversing operation actually work.

```.swift
cube4 == cube // true
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Face | Specifies a face direction of cube |
| Surface | Specifies a face of cube that contains tiles |
| Tile | A suface of a cubelet.  A surface contains 3x3, 9 `Tile`s. |
| Turn | A turn direction either `clockwise`, `counterclockwise`, or `double` |
| Movement | A single turn action which face and which turn direction |
| Cube | A whole cube with six surfaces |


### Why did I do this? 

Good question, but I do not have a good answer for that question.
